# R functions for analysis and plots of ecological networks
This is a work in progress associated to the development of an R package in preparation.

(1) functions to analyse ecological networks on the basis of cycling analysis, canonical trophic aggregation and information/attribute indices. 

(2) functions to visualize analysis outputs (Lindeman Spine, Trophic Transfer Efficiency Pyramid, Barplots of Indices) and networks. 

(3) functions to randomize network flows and test for statistical significance of analysis outputs.

(4) functions to mass-balance ecological networks.

(5) functions to convert SCOR files into Transfer matrix and vectors of Imports, Exports, Respiration.
